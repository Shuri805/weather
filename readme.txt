The Goal
We wish to have our user type in a location, either by name, zip code, or by lat/long. Once they do we wish to show them nicely formatted Current Weather Data, an Hourly forecast for the next few days, and as a bonus, a few maps (for example: precipitation intensity, accumulated precipitation, or air temperature).

Use Radio Buttons in your search form to specifiy name, zip code, or lat/long. Also use Radio Buttons to toggle between maps.

Create an interface, get the data from the API, and build out the results. The styling and layout are up to you. The goal is to make it pleasant to use, and easy to read out the results.
